Yeast network, named "YeastNet.txt", consists of 2390 nodes and 16127 edges.
Human network, named "HumanNet.txt", consists of 9141 nodes and 41456 edges.
The file "table.Yeast-Human.txt" is the homologous table between Yeast and Human, obtained by the matlab program "GetTable.m" from YEAST-uniprot-20120518.fasta and Human-20120513.fasta.
The file "MIPS.txt" contains all proteins in YeastNet.txt,and 'Yeast-2390' is the network name.
