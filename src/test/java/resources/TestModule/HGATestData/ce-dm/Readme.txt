CE and DM Netwoks are from http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cb/mna/isobase/#userconsent#
(Reference:Chindelevitch, Leonid, Chung-Shou Liao, and Bonnie Berger. "Local optimization for global alignment of protein interaction networks." Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing. Vol. 15. 2010.).

CE network, named ce.txt, consists of 2745 nodes and 5851 edges.
DM network, named dm.txt, consists of 6709 nodes and 26712 edges.
The file "table.ce-dm.txt" is the homologous table between CE and DM, converted from ce-dm.evals.
The file "MIPS-CE.txt" contains all proteins in 'ce.txt',and 'CE-2745N' is the network name.
